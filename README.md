# LlamaPy

LlamaPy is a Python project for natural language processing tasks using a custom model called LLaMA3. This model is designed for tokenization and language generation tasks.


## Architecture
- Transformer-based architecture
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Multiple layers for hierarchical representation learning
- Long-range sequence modeling capabilities

## Specifications

- **Dependencies:** LlamaPy relies on the following Python libraries:
  - `torch` for deep learning computations
  - `nltk` for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization
  - `tqdm` for progress tracking during training
- **Model Parameters:**
  - `hidden_dim`: Dimensionality of the model's hidden states
  - `num_heads`: Number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism
  - `num_layers`: Number of layers in the transformer architecture
  - `max_length`: Maximum sequence length supported by the model
- **Training Procedure:**
  - The model is trained using an Adam optimizer with a cross-entropy loss function.
  - Training data is fed to the model in batches, with a specified batch size and sequence length.
  - Training progresses over multiple epochs, with progress tracked using the tqdm library.


## Installation

To use LlamaPy, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tqdm nltk torch
```

You also need to download the NLTK corpora. Run the following commands after installing NLTK:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('gutenberg')
```

## Usage
Here's a brief overview of how to use LlamaPy:

- Import the necessary modules:

```python
import subprocess
import nltk
from tqdm import tqdm
import torch
```

Next, run the code in a jupyter notebook, which would train the llama3 model on nltk's gutenberg corpus.

2. **Model Initialization:**
   - Initialize the LLaMA3 model with appropriate parameters such as vocabulary size, hidden dimension, number of heads, and number of layers.

3. **Training:**
   - Train the model using your dataset by feeding tokenized sequences to the model in batches.
   - Adjust training parameters such as batch size, sequence length, learning rate, and number of epochs as needed.

4. **Inference:**
   - Once trained, use the model for text generation or other natural language processing tasks.
   - Provide input sequences to the model and obtain predictions for the next tokens.
